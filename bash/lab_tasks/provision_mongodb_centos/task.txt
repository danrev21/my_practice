    2. (as root) Create user mongo with primary group staff, UID=600, GID=600
    3. (as root) Create folders /apps/mongo/, give 750 permissions, set owner mongo:staff
    4. (as root) Create folders /apps/mongodb/, give 750 permissions, set owner mongo:staff
    5. (as root) Create folders /logs/mongo/, give 740 permissions, set owner mongo:staff
    6. (as mongo) Download with wget https://fastdl.mongodb.org/linux/mongodb-linux-x86_64-3.6.5.tgz
    7. (as mongo) Download with curl https://fastdl.mongodb.org/src/mongodb-src-r3.6.5.tar.gz
    8. (as mongo) Unpack mongodb-linux-x86_64-3.6.5.tgz to /tmp/
    9. (as mongo) Copy ./mongodb-linux-x86_64-3.6.5/* to /apps/mongo/
    10. (as mongo) Update PATH on runtime by setting it to PATH=<mongodb-install-directory>/bin:$PATH

        a. Pre-Start: Check if file /apps/mongo/bin/mongod and folders (/apps/mongodb/ and /logs/mongo/) exist, check if permissions and ownership are set correctly.
    17. (as root) Add mongo.service to autostart

Check
    1. Run mongod from Name_Surname
    2. Prove that process is running

        b. Corresponding [initandlisten] message in mongo log 
        c. Port is really listening
